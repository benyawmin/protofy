Flutter technical test project for enter

Dear Examiners of this technical project, salam,
Unfortunately due to my tooth extraction surgery and subsequent headaches, I could not finish the whole project before the specified time
But I think you can already see my approach which is TDD clean architecture and it would also be the same
for the rest of the code If I could write it. I would use the card management bloc to remove and editing events for cards and change state based on them and then save or remove the card from the list and add it to the secure storage.
kIsWeb boolean could also be used to separate web and mobile widgets as the condition and
customize the widgets based on platform and the condition (mobile platforms can also be detected using the same
approach with the devicetype condition).
